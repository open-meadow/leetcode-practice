# leetcode-practice

In order to keep my GitHub updated, I will upload any leetcode challenges I do.

"success" folder contains any solution I was able to figure out for/by myself (maybe with minor googling).

Everything that doesn't fit there goes in "learning_opportunity". I have a sneaking suspicion it's going to be a lot bigger.

I might come back to these later:
